# River Review

![River Review logo](assets/logo/river-review-logo.svg)

RR (River Review) is a flow-aware review assistant that moves with your delivery stream.

## Flow at a glance

- **Upstream → Midstream → Downstream**: design, implementation, and test/QA phases stay connected.
- **Upstream-first**: catch design drift early with ADR-aware skills.
- **Stream router**: picks skills per requested phase or change set.
- **(Future) Riverbed Memory**: retains past findings, ADR links, and WontFix decisions for consistent follow-up.

## Repository layout

```
README.md
assets/           # official RR logos/icons
schemas/          # JSON Schema for skills and outputs
skills/           # upstream/midstream/downstream skills (Markdown + frontmatter)
scripts/          # setup and skill refactor utilities
docs/             # tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation
.github/river-review/ # River Review checklists shared with CI/agents
```

## Quick start (GitHub Actions)

Minimal workflow to run River Review in the midstream phase:

```yaml
name: River Review
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: Run River Review (midstream)
        uses: s977043/river-review@v1
        with:
          phase: midstream
```

## Skill definition

Skills use YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown for guidance. Required fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `phase`, `applyTo`.

```markdown
---
id: rr-midstream-performance-001
name: Midstream Performance Guardrails
description: Ensure midstream changes avoid common performance pitfalls.
phase: midstream
applyTo:
  - "src/**/*.ts"
tags: [performance, efficiency]
severity: major
---

- Check for accidental O(n^2) loops over large collections.
- Prefer streaming/iterators when handling large payloads.
- Flag synchronous I/O in request paths.
- Suggest benchmarks when risky changes are detected.
```

## Schemas & loader

- JSON Schema lives in `schemas/skill.schema.json` and `schemas/output.schema.json`.
- `scripts/rr_validate_skills.py` loads and validates skills recursively with `--phase upstream|midstream|downstream|all`.
- `scripts/setup_river_reviewer.sh` bootstraps the directory layout and placeholder files.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance. Issues and PRs are welcome as we expand River Review.

# River Review Glossary

- **Upstream**: requirements, design, and architecture phase (including ADRs) where early review prevents costly rework.
- **Midstream**: implementation and pull request phase focused on code quality, security, and developer experience.
- **Downstream**: test, QA, and release-prep phase to verify coverage, resilience, and regression protection.
- **Skill**: a YAML frontmatter + Markdown unit of review guidance executed by River Review.
- **Stream Router**: logic that selects and runs skills based on the requested phase and change context.
- **Riverbed Memory (Future)**: persistent context layer for previous findings, ADR references, and WontFix decisions to keep reviews consistent over time.

# Skill Schema

River Review skills use YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown for guidance. The metadata fields are validated by `schemas/skill.schema.json`.

## Fields

- `id` (string, required): unique identifier (e.g., `rr-upstream-design-architecture-001`); stable across moves/renames.
- `name` (string, required): human-readable skill name.
- `phase` (string, required): one of `upstream`, `midstream`, or `downstream`.
- `tags` (string[], optional): keywords that group related skills.
- `severity` (string, optional): `info`, `minor`, `major`, or `critical` to indicate impact.
- `applyTo` (string[], required): glob patterns for files the skill should evaluate.
- `description` (string, required): concise explanation of what the skill checks.

## YAML Example (midstream performance)

```yaml
---
id: rr-midstream-performance-002
name: Midstream Performance Budget Check
phase: midstream
tags:
  - performance
  - latency
severity: major
applyTo:
  - "src/**/*.ts"
  - "packages/**/src/**/*.{ts,js}"
description: Flag midstream changes that risk latency regressions or heavy resource use.
---

Ensure changed code paths avoid unnecessary synchronous I/O, unbounded concurrency, and repeated heavy computations. Recommend benchmarks when touching hot paths.
