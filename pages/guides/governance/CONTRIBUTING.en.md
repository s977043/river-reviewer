# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in River Reviewer. We accept Pull Requests and Issues according to the following policies.

## PR Basic Policy

- Limit one PR to one purpose. Split multiple changes.
- Clearly state what changed and why in the title and description.
- Include links to related files if affecting other docs or code.

## Code and Documents

- Write documents in Japanese (Japanese version is Source of Truth). If preparing English version, add `.en.md` with same name; prioritize Japanese version if content diverges.
- Provide English examples for technical terms if needed.
- Follow the style guide (See [WRITING_GUIDE.md](WRITING_GUIDE.md)).
- Record in PR if adding/changing labels or checks for review.

## Issue Reporting

- Register bug reports and feature requests as Issues.
- Specifically write reproduction steps, expected results, and actual results.

Create Issues from templates (`Issues -> New issue`, or [issues/new/choose](https://github.com/s977043/river-reviewer/issues/new/choose)).

Refer to `pages/guides/governance/issue-management.md` for label guidelines and triage policy.

Thank you for your cooperation!
