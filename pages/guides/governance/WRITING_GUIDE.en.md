## Interim Recommendations

Until the complete guide is ready, please follow these basic recommendations:

- **Clarity**: Aim for concise and clear sentences.
- **Consistency**: Match the style of existing documents.
- **Accuracy**: Verify technical content thoroughly.
- **Accessibility**: Make content easy to understand for all readers.
- **Language Policy**: Japanese version (`.md`) is primary. If adding an English version, create `.en.md` with the same name. Priority is given to the Japanese version if content diverges.
