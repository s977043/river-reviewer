# Run Phase-Specific Review

Target a single phase when you only want Upstream, Midstream, or Downstream feedback.

## Steps

1. Tag each skill with the correct `phase` in its front matter.
2. Limit the review scope in CI when needed:

   ```yaml
   on:
     pull_request:
       paths:
         - 'pages/**' # Upstream-focused example
   ```

3. For local runs, execute only the relevant skills by filtering files or temporarily narrowing `applyTo` globs.
4. Share the chosen phase in your PR template so reviewers know which checks to expect.

## Verification

- Confirm the reviewer only loads skills whose `phase` matches the targeted segment.
- Add a small change in a different phase to verify it's ignored.
