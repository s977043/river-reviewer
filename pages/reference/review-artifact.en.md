# Review Artifact

A structured JSON output schema for River Reviewer run results. It bundles the execution plan, repository context, findings, and debug information into a single artifact that can be consumed by audit, memory ingestion, and evaluation pipelines.

## Overview

The existing `output.schema.json` defines the format of individual findings (issues), but does not cover the metadata of a complete review run -- which skills were executed, which files were targeted, the planner's reasoning, and so on.

The Review Artifact schema provides a complete record of a review execution.

- **Schema file**: [`schemas/review-artifact.schema.json`](../../schemas/review-artifact.schema.json)
- **JSON Schema Draft**: 2020-12
- **Version**: `1` (tracked via the `version` field)

## Field Reference

### Top-Level

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | `string` | Yes | Schema version. Currently always `"1"`. |
| `timestamp` | `string` (date-time) | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the review run completed. |
| `phase` | `string` | Yes | SDLC phase of the review. `upstream` / `midstream` / `downstream`. |
| `status` | `string` | Yes | Terminal status. `ok` / `no-changes` / `skipped-by-label` / `error`. |
| `plan` | `object` | No | Execution plan. See below. |
| `findings` | `array` | No | Array of review findings. Each item conforms to the issue schema in `output.schema.json`. |
| `context` | `object` | No | Repository and diff context. |
| `debug` | `object` | No | Free-form debug information. Structure is not guaranteed across versions. |

### `plan` Object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `selectedSkills` | `array` | Skills selected for execution. Each item has `id` (required), `name` (required), `phase`, and `modelHint`. |
| `skippedSkills` | `array` | Skills excluded from the run. Each item has `id` (required) and `reasons` (required, string array). |
| `plannerMode` | `string` | AI planner mode. `off` / `order` / `prune`. |
| `plannerReasons` | `array` | Per-skill reasoning from the AI planner. Each item has `id` and `reason`. |
| `impactTags` | `array` | Tags describing the impact area of changes (e.g. `security`, `performance`). |

### `context` Object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `repoRoot` | `string` | Absolute path to the repository root. |
| `defaultBranch` | `string` | Default branch name (e.g. `main`). |
| `mergeBase` | `string` | Git merge-base commit SHA used for diffing. |
| `changedFiles` | `array` | List of file paths included in the review diff. |
| `tokenEstimate` | `number` | Estimated token count of the optimized diff text. |
| `reduction` | `number` | Percentage of tokens saved by diff optimization (0--100). |

### `status` Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ok` | Review completed successfully. |
| `no-changes` | No diff to review. |
| `skipped-by-label` | Run was skipped due to a PR label match. |
| `error` | An error occurred during the run. |

## Downstream Consumers

The Review Artifact is designed to be consumed by the following systems.

### CI (GitHub Actions)

- Retrieves review results as structured data for generating PR comments and status checks.
- The `status` field enables early-return decisions.

### Riverbed Memory

- Stores review results as repository-specific learning data.
- Records which skills were effective from the `plan` section.
- Analyzes historical finding patterns from `findings`.

### Eval (Evaluation Pipeline)

- Compares `plan` and `findings` against evaluation fixtures to measure skill accuracy.
- Tracks diff optimization effectiveness via `context.tokenEstimate` and `context.reduction`.
