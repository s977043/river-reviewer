# Known Limitations

River Reviewer is currently in the stage of establishing its OSS foundation. Here are notes for usage.

- Local execution (`river run`) is primarily for "preview/verification" purposes (supports `--dry-run` and fallback when API key is missing).
- Skills are a mix of samples and production-ready ones. Adjust them for your project as needed.
- Since breaking changes may occur, we recommend pinning GitHub Actions to a release tag (e.g., `@v0.1.0`).

See `ROADMAP.md` for the roadmap.
