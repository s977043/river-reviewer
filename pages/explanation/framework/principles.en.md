title: 'Part I—Foundational Principles: Adapting Human-Centric Review for AI'

## Decomposing the Gold Standard

AI as "Enhanced Linter" is insufficient. Core of what human review observes:

- **Design**: Does change fit architecture?

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended? / User value

- **Complexity / Maintainability**: Simplification room / Future understandability

- **Tests**: Appropriate and inclusive?

- **Naming / Comments / Style / Docs**: Consistent readability

Health of Review itself:

- **Small, Focused** (~400 lines / review target)

- **Collaborative / Non-adversarial**, Start with **Questions** not assumptions

- **Polite and Constructive** feedback

## Role as Architecture Guardian

AI should become an **Architecture Suitability Checker** visualizing dependency graphs, boundaries, and layers.
Embed **Continuous Improvement** into decision logic so valuable changes are not blocked by minor nits.
