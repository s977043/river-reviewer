title: Welcome to River Reviewer

River Reviewer (RR) is a framework for organizing and executing team review perspectives along the **Upstream → Midstream → Downstream** flow. Skills are defined using YAML frontmatter + Markdown and validated against `schemas/skill.schema.json`.

This documentation covers:

- **Explanation**: Design philosophy and flow mechanics.
- **Tutorials**: Hands-on guides for creating skills.
- **How-to**: Practical guides for GitHub Actions integration, tracing, etc.
- **Reference**: Schema definitions and CLI references.

We recommend starting with the flow overview and then exploring tutorials or references as needed.
