# Documentation instructions

- Match the repository’s existing documentation structure and conventions.
- Prefer clear headings, short paragraphs, and runnable examples.
- If docs appear to follow the Diátaxis split (tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation), keep the doc in the right category.
- When adding a new doc:
  - add links from the appropriate index/README if one exists
  - keep multilingual pairing consistent with the repo’s convention (e.g., `.en.md` when used)
- Don’t let docs drift: update them in the same PR as behavior changes.
- Procedural content (setup/release/ops) should live under `docs/runbook/` to keep responsibilities clear.
