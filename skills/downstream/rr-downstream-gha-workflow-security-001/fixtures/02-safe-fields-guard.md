# Test Case: Safe Fields and env-Passing (False Positive Guard)

## Description

Verifies the skill does NOT flag constrained/safe fields and the correct `env:`-passing pattern.

+        run: echo "$TITLE"
```

## Expected Behavior

The skill should:

1. NOT flag `github.event.pull_request.number` / `github.actor` (constrained, non-injectable fields)
2. NOT flag the `env:`-passed `TITLE` usage (the correct mitigation)
3. Produce no findings
