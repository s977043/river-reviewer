# River Reviewer Skills

This directory contains River Reviewer skills - reusable code review patterns organized by SDLC phase.

## What are Skills?

Skills are modular, version-controlled review patterns that encapsulate:

- **Review logic** - What to check and how to check it
- **Context requirements** - What information the skill needs (diff, full file, tests, etc.)
- **Evaluation criteria** - How to measure the skill's effectiveness
- **Test fixtures** - Sample inputs and expected outputs

Each skill is a **first-class asset** with its own version, tests, and documentation.

└── agent-skills/                   # Legacy references/checklists (skill bodies live in agent-*.md)
```

Some skills keep fixtures/prompt/eval assets in sibling folders for documentation and evaluation, but the source of truth for each skill is the `.md` file listed above.

## Skill Format

Skills use a single format: YAML frontmatter + Markdown body.

```markdown
---
id: rr-midstream-example-001
name: Example Skill
description: Example skill description
phase: midstream
applyTo:
  - 'src/**/*.ts'
tags: [sample, midstream]
severity: minor
inputContext: [diff]
outputKind: [findings, actions]
modelHint: balanced
priority: 10
---

## Guidance

- Keep review instructions concise (around 10 lines) and actionable.
- Include Non-goals and False-positive guards to control noise.
```

## Creating a New Skill

### Using the Scaffolding Tool (Recommended)

```bash
npm run create:skill
```

This interactive tool will:

1. Prompt for skill metadata (ID, name, description, etc.)
2. Generate a Markdown skill file with YAML frontmatter
3. (Optional) Create fixture/eval folders if needed

### Manual Creation

1. Copy the template:

   ```bash
   cp skills/_template.md skills/<phase>/<skill-id>.md
   ```

2. Fill in the YAML frontmatter (id, name, description, phase/applyTo, inputContext, outputKind, priority, etc.)
3. Keep the body concise with Guidance / Non-goals / False-positive guards
4. (Optional) Add fixtures or promptfoo configs under a sibling directory if you need evaluations

## Validating Skills

```bash
npm run skills:validate
```

## Testing Skills

### Run promptfoo Evaluation

```bash
cd skills/<phase>/<skill-id>
npx promptfoo eval
```

### Run All Fixture Tests

```bash
npm run eval:fixtures
```

## Skill Phases

### Upstream (Design & Architecture)

Focus: Design decisions, ADRs, architecture patterns

- **Input Context**: ADR files, design docs, commit messages
- **Output**: Design feedback, alternative suggestions, questions
- **Examples**: ADR quality, API design review, architecture patterns

### Midstream (Implementation)

Focus: Code quality, security, observability

- **Input Context**: Diff, full files, tests
- **Output**: Code findings, refactoring suggestions, security alerts
- **Examples**: Code quality, security scan, observability checks

### Downstream (Testing & Release)

Focus: Test coverage, release readiness

- **Input Context**: Test files, coverage reports, diff
- **Output**: Test recommendations, coverage gaps, release checklist
- **Examples**: Test coverage, integration test review

## Registry

The `registry.yaml` file maintains a catalog of all skills with:

- Skill metadata and versions
- Tag-based categorization
- Recommended skills for common use cases
- Phase-based organization

See [registry.yaml](./registry.yaml) for the complete catalog.

## Best Practices

1. **One skill, one concern** - Keep skills focused on a single review aspect
2. **Write tests** - Add fixtures and golden files for regression testing
3. **Document thoroughly** - Include clear examples and non-goals
4. **Version carefully** - Use semantic versioning for breaking changes
5. **Evaluate regularly** - Run promptfoo evaluations to measure effectiveness
