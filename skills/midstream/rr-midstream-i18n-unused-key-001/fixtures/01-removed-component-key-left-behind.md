# Test Case: Removed Component Leaves Unused i18n Key (Should Detect)

## Description

This test verifies that the skill correctly identifies an unused locale key left in the JSON file after the corresponding UI component was removed.

```

## Expected Behavior

The skill should:

1. Detect that `UserBadge.tsx` was deleted and no longer calls `t('userBadge.roleLabel')`
2. Flag that the `userBadge.roleLabel` key added to `en.json` is now unreferenced
3. Suggest removing the `userBadge` section from all locale files
4. Set severity to "minor" and note the dead-code risk
