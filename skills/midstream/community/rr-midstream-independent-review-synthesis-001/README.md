# Independent Review Synthesis — eval scaffolding

Status: **fixtures + eval scaffolding only**. `golden/` intentionally empty.

See `../rr-midstream-modern-web-semantic-001/README.md` for the rationale
(hand-written goldens reproduce the "posture, not progress" anti-pattern) and
the `promptfoo eval` workflow to generate verified goldens.

Promotion to `recommended: true` in `skills/registry.yaml` requires verified
goldens + promptfoo eval in CI.

## Phase context

Phase 1 of [#911](https://github.com/s977043/river-reviewer/issues/911):
skill body + fixtures + eval scaffolding only. Phase 2 will add artifact
contract extensions (`findings[]` provenance fields, schema `inputContext`
enum additions). Phase 3 will add CLI / Actions ensemble mode.
