# Test Case: Major Finding Without Suppression Entry

## Description

A `major` severity finding is detected by another midstream skill, and there is **no existing suppression entry** for the corresponding fingerprint in Riverbed Memory. The skill should explain the suppression vs. fix decision and surface the HIGH_SEVERITY guard so reviewers know that anything other than `accepted_risk` will not auto-suppress the finding on later PRs.

## Input Diff

```

## Companion finding (out of band)

`rr-midstream-logging-observability-001` has emitted (in the same PR):

```text
**Finding:** try / catch swallows the upstream error without re-throwing or logging
**Evidence:** src/api/users.ts:18
**Severity:** major
**Confidence:** medium
```

There is **no `type: 'suppression'` entry** in Riverbed Memory for this fingerprint.

## Expected Behavior

The skill should:

1. Recognize that a `major` finding has been raised in the same PR with no existing suppression.
2. Surface the HIGH_SEVERITY guard rule: `major`/`critical` findings can only be auto-suppressed via `feedbackType=accepted_risk`.
3. Frame the choice as `(a) implement the fix` vs. `(b) add a suppression with explicit rationale`, **not** "always suppress".
4. Quote the `river suppression add` CLI form with `--feedback accepted_risk` and require a non-empty `--rationale`.
5. Severity of the skill's own finding stays `minor` (this is a workflow nudge, not a security claim).
