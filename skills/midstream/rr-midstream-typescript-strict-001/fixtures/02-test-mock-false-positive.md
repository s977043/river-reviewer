# Test Case: Test Mock with Type Assertion (False Positive Guard)

## Description

This test verifies that the skill does NOT flag `as unknown as` used in test files for creating mocks, which is an established TypeScript testing pattern.

+      save: jest.fn(),

## Expected Behavior

The skill should:

1. Recognize this is a test file (path contains `/tests/`)
2. NOT flag `as unknown as UserRepository` in a mock setup as a type safety violation
3. Either return no findings or explicitly acknowledge the mock context
4. NOT produce false positive warnings about `any` or type assertions in test mocks
