# Test Case: Over-permissive `allow read, write: if true` (Happy Path)

## Description

Verifies the skill flags a Firestore rule that grants unconditional read and write access (`if true`), allowing anyone to overwrite any user's document.

## Input Diff

+      allow read, write: if true;
+    }
+  }
+}
```

## Expected Behavior

The skill should:

1. Flag `allow read, write: if true;` as an unconditional grant with no auth or ownership check
2. Note that any client can read and overwrite any user's document
3. Reference the rules-and-auth convention (require `request.auth.uid == userId`)
