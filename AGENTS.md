# AGENTS.md—River Review

## Scope

Canonical instructions for all AI coding agents in this repository.
Tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.codex/`, `copilot-instructions.md`) contain only tool-specific policy and point here for repo-wide rules.
If a rule applies to all tools, it belongs in this file.

## Repository Map

| Directory                | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `skills/`                | Core review skills and registry content              |

| `pages/`                 | Public docs; Japanese content is the source of truth |
| `docs/`                  | Internal notes and runbooks; ask before editing      |

## Package Manager

Use **npm**.

| Task                    | Command                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install                 | `npm install` or `npm ci`                                         |
| Lint                    | `npm run lint`                                                    |
| Test                    | `npm test`                                                        |
| Skills validation       | `npm run skills:validate`                                         |
| Agent skills validation | `npm run agent-skills:validate`                                   |
| Agent definitions       | `npm run agents:validate`                                         |
| Local link check        | `npm run check:links:local`                                       |
| Docs dev server         | `npm run dev`                                                     |
| Docs build              | `npm run build`                                                   |
| TypeScript check        | `npm run build` in `runners/node-api/` (no root typecheck script) |

## Safety

- Do not read or commit `.env*`, `secrets/`, `*.pem`, or `*.key`.
- Do not make direct network calls (curl, wget, fetch) from scripts or code. Allowed CLI tools like `gh` are exempt.
- Do not use destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, etc.).
- Do not hand-edit `package-lock.json`.
- Do not push directly to `main` or to already-merged PR branches. If fixes are needed after merge, create a new branch and new PR.
- Do not omit timeout and exception handling in code that calls external APIs.

## Edit Scope

- **Editable**: `pages/`, `skills/`, `schemas/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `AGENT_LEARNINGS.md`
- **Ask before editing**: `docs/`, `assets/`, `src/`, `runners/`, `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Never edit**: `package-lock.json`, `LICENSE*`, `CITATION.cff`

## Verification Criteria

Run the applicable checks before handoff. All must pass.

| Changed path                           | Required validation                |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `skills/**/*.md`                       | `npm run skills:validate`          |
| `skills/agent-skills/**`               | `npm run agent-skills:validate`    |
| `.github/agents/` or `.claude/agents/` | `npm run agents:validate`          |
| `pages/**/*.md`                        | `npm run check:links:local`        |
| `src/` changes that affect skills      | Confirm schema and skill alignment |
| Any file                               | `npm run lint && npm test`         |

Completion gate: all applicable validations pass. If any fail, fix before handoff.

## Workflow

- Keep each change small and cohesive.
- If `src/` changes, confirm schema and skill alignment first.
- Run the verification criteria above before handoff.
- Prefer existing patterns over new conventions.

## Self-Review Checklist

Apply before handoff. Derived from retrospectives where defects shipped and were caught only by multi-perspective review (see `docs/development/retrospectives/2026-05-21-25.md`).

### Codify-then-validate (when adding a rule or convention)

Before merging a new rule (Stop conditions, severity policy, naming convention, etc.), answer:

1. What 3 concrete scenarios would make this rule fail or be misapplied?
2. What is the reopen / exception condition? (e.g. for a Stop rule: how does it lift?)
3. What is the soft-violation gray zone? (e.g. "status report during Stop"—is it allowed?)

If any answer is "I don't know," defer the rule until the gap is filled. Codify-without-validate produced a same-session defect in #898 → #902.

### Code-gen review (when writing a workflow / script / automation)

Before merging GitHub Actions workflows, shell scripts, or any CI automation, verify:

1. Concurrency: can two simultaneous invocations race on shared state (refs, locks, deploys)? Add a `concurrency:` group if yes.
2. Default coupling: do hard-coded defaults (branch names, package names, paths) silently break when an upstream config changes? Prefer auto-detection or fail-loud over silent fallback.
3. Failure mode: what happens on partial failure (network error mid-PATCH, exit code 0 but nothing changed)? Is the error surfaced or swallowed?

These were the convergent gaps in `.github/workflows/release-please-kick.yml` and `scripts/release-please-kick.sh` at first delivery, fixed in #902.

## Commit Attribution

AI-authored commits MUST include a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer with the acting model identity.

## Project Conventions

- `README.md` is the Japanese source of truth; `README.en.md` is best effort.
- `skills/` content is the product surface; validate it after edits.
- Record only durable, reusable repo learnings in `AGENT_LEARNINGS.md`.
- Use English or Japanese skill searches when locating repo conventions.
